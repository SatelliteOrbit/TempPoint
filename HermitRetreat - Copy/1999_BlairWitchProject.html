    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>This movie is a testament to how directing and acting can carry a film. With nothing but a couple of consumer-grade video cameras and three competent actors, the filmmakers made one of the best horror movies out there. This movie birthed the found footage genre and it is as terrifying as it is unique in its storytelling. You should consider looking into the marketing campaign of this film, an interesting story in its own right. Not to be confused with the low-quality 2016 remake "Blair Witch".<p>
