    <p>When you think of movies that pioneered special effects, you probably think of Avatar, Toy Story, Titanic, Jurassic Park, or any number of Marvel movies. You probably don't think of a black-and-white film from 1933 where a big monkey steals a woman. The stop-motion animations and special effects were revolutionary and laid the groundwork for blockbusters to come.<p>
