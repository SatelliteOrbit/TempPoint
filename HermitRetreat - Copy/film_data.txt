Details to be included in a film database:

The goal of the database is to document all of the films that I own either physically or digitally. All entries must have the following information:

    -Title
    -Year of release
    -Extra details surrounding specific version (director's cut, theatrical release, censored, etc)
    -Rating
    -Synopsis
    -Actor, director, writer credits
    -Language
    -(If physical) region-locking
    -Physical or digital?
    -Poster image (standardized size)

Rating System (general guidelines, rating is discretionary)
    Takes into account multiple variables:
        -Sexual content (the presence, length, tastefulness, context as well as the inclusion/duration/context of nudity will affect rating)
        -Explicit language (curse words and slurs, rating depandent on amount and content of explicit language)
        -Drug use (includes scenes of intoxication, excludes socially acceptable use of alcohol and tobacco)
        -Violence (refers mainly to gore and violence meant to excite, scenes of violence meant to disturb/frighten viewer falls under distressing imagery)
        -Distressing imagery (general multi-use category, includes images of explicit/near-explicit sexual violence)

        G
            -None of the above except low amounts of explicit language
        PG
            -Low amounts of above
            -0% distressing imagery and drug use
        PG+
            -Same as PG, except with low levels of distressing imagery and drug use
            -Brief/no nudity
        R
            -All variables
            -Present but mostly tasteful use of sexual content, may contain nudity
            -Distressing imagery present
        X
            -Only watch alone, otherwise deliberate heavily
            -This rating is automatically assigned to media with explicit/near-explicit sexual violence

The above specifies how an individual page is to be done, these pages will be organized by year in a table of contents
