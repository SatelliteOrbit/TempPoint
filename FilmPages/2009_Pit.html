    <p>The low production value and candid nature really gives the documentary a personal feel. Unfortunately this film was direct-to-video. It was broadcast on cable TV but never sold in home media. The rarity and obsucrity of this film also means that it is basically impossible to find it on torrent sites. Keep watching youtube/dailymotion/vimeo and keep ytdlp handy, you just might find it with a couple hundred/thousand views before it gets taken down. Yes, I'm serious. That really is the only way to watch this thing anymore. I'm probably the one of a couple hundred people in the world who actually know and care about this little gem.</p>
    <p>What is even more unfortunate about the obsucrity of this film is the subject matter it deals with. Open outcry trading has been surpassed by online trading, this movie was filmed in the latter-end of that transition. As horrible as it sounds, this film is the only way to understand the personal and social nature of open outcry. And the only way you can find it is under some business professor's channel on a random video-hosting site.</p>
