    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>I had to limit the credits for the sake brevity, but this movie is full of strong characters played by great actors. This really is a war epic that exposes you to a variety of unique personalities strung along the main character's long and treacherous path to his objective. I'll probably get a remastered widescreen version at some point so I can have better resolution than an old video tape. If you get confused by the different edits, the final cut is sufficient. Don't bother with anything longer than 160 mins.<p>
