    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>Despite its age this film holds up amazingly well. The comedy is mainly based on slapstick and the gags range between being hilarious and death-defying. This comedy gives the film a timeless quality. Keaton's well-meaning but unlucky character pushes forward the plot and makes the romance extremely compelling. The chemistry between Buster and Sally Richards is full of emotion and heart. The Cameraman is nearly a century old now but it still stands among the greatest comedies and romances.<p>
