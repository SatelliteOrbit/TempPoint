    <p>If you're reading this database in sequence (why would you? that's the stupidest thing I could think of), you might be wondering why the Germans were making so many movies in the '20s. Although a surprise to some, Germany rivaled Hollywood in terms of film production before the Nazis took power and the Second World War started.</p>
    <p>On top of being an excellent and compelling crime thriller, M is revolutionary for being one of the first major "talkies". That is, a film with sound. In the silent era, the only sound accompanying a movie was an instrumental score being played by actual live musicians in the venue. In M, sound isn't just a gimmick but something central to the plot. It expanded the vocabulary of the filmmaker and the actor so that they could tell stories and express themselves in ways never before dreamed of. M is as fun to watch as it is important. Highly recommend.<p>
