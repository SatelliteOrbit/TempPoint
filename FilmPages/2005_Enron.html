    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>For some reason not a lot of people I talk to are aware of Enron. The documentary has some silly editing and music choices, but the subject is covered in a good degree of depth. Enron was a big deal, but even if you don't care about that the story on display just drags you in. A must-watch if you're studying business and are learning about business ethics. Think about the various people involved in this mess and ask yourself what you would do if you were in that situation.<p>
