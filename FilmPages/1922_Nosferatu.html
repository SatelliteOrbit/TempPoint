    <p>This movie is a must-watch if you're looking into silent film at all. Considering the artistic direction, you'll be left with some images you can never unsee.</p>
    <p>Though it is roughly based on the Bram Stoker novel Dracula, the filmmakers never actually got the rights. In a lawsuit filed by Stoker's estate, it was decided that all copies of the film be destroyed. Thankfully, it wasn't. This fate was unfortunately a rarity among silent films (an estimated 80-90% of silent films are now considered lost).</p>
