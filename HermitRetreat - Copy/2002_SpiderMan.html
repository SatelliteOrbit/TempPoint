    <p>I know the CGI didn't age well, but goddammit this is one of the best superhero movies out there. I might be biased since I grew up watching this movie (before I settled on Batman, Spiderman used to be my favourite), but I didn't fully appreciate this one until my most recent viewing. Peter Parker is great character and it's amazing seeing him progress throughout the film. The romance subplot that underlies the superhero story is also really great. It's just a good, big budget, well-made, blockbuster superhero movie.<p>
