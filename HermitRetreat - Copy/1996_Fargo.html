    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>A well-done crime thriller that incorporates violence and grit with the Coen's signature black humour. The story is exciting and the acting is great across the board. A personal favourite. There was also a TV show made based on this movie where each season is different story within the same universe. From the first 3 seasons I've watched it seems very good.<p>
