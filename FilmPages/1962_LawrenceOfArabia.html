    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>This movie is one of the main Hollywood epics alongside the Ten Commandments. Rather than focusing on scale and spectacle, this epic is more down-to-earth and character-focused. The history behind the subject matter really feeds into the characters, giving them a human feel and compelling progression. You will not be disappointed when you look into the history after watching this movie, it is more accurate than most historical films.<p>
