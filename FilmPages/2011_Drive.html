    <p>Literally me. The best feature of the movie is the silence, that seconds-long space in between characters' dialogue. By saying nothing between each other, tension is heightened and characters feel more human. That seems like a weird thing to say but you'll understand when you see it. It's a very good watch, one of my favourites.<p>
