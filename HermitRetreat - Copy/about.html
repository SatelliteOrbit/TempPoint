    <h3 class="subhead1">The Site</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Sheltered Garden. This is a site written by me to document my projects. All parts of this site were written by myself in very simple, static HTML with some CSS for styling. So far, only one of these projects is up on the front page: Operation KINO. This is a page which lists the movies I own and have watched alongside my personal insights into the individual entries. For future projects I want to create a chapter-by-chapter analysis of Moby Dick and a personal gallery to supersede my current social media accounts.</p>

    <h3 class="subhead1">Personal Details</h3>
    <p>My name is Ahmed Msaibawi. On most social media I go by the username "SatelliteOrbit". My hobbies include urban road cycling, stamp-collecting, and reading. I also have a strong interest in film. Although I know a decent amount about HTML, I hope to use this site as an opportunity to learn more. I want to leverage CSS for more complex and appealing visuals although there is a strong appeal in a simplistic and minimal visual style. Aside from my personal interests I am a third year accounting student at the University of Calgary.</p>
