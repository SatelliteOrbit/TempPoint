    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>Not a lot of people associate this movie with Spielberg. The marketing focused more on Tom Cruise as a result of 2001's A.I. (written and directed by Spielberg) performing poorly in the States. The action is well-done but what really steals the show in this movie is the setting. I have not seen a depiction of a low-life cyberpunk future quite like this one. I'm sure the premise has some plot holes or breaks with logic, but I can't pinpoint any and I'm sure they're minor. Highly recommend.<p>
