    <p>What can I say about this one that hasn't already been said? It's not the greatest film ever made (neither is any film), but it is one of the greatest put to the silver screen. What I like most about this movie are the characters. All the characters are well-acted and well-written, giving them a human feel (this is important, given the character-driven nature of the story). Charles Foster Kane himself is dead and is only seen in flashbacks but still displays humanity and emotion on par with the living characters. Go watch it.<p>
