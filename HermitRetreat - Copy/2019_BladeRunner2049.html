    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>Another entry into the "literally me" genre. Also, another hit by Villeneuve which cements the fact that he is the best thing to come out of Quebec. I was originally a bit antsy upon hearing that Blade Runner was getting a sequel. In an age of cash grabs and pointless remakes this movie is an absolute gem. It is certainly a worthy sequel to Blade Runner and even surpasses it in some respects. People in the future will consider this a must-watch similar to how we see movies like Taxi Driver or the orginal Blade Runner today.<p>
