    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>This movie was a very international production. Produced by a Korean company, filmed mostly in Prague, starring American and English actors, and based off a French graphic novel. It is violent, stylistic, and full of action while still delivering some very emotional character moments. There are a few characters in here that don't speak or aren't mentioned by name who still leave strong impressions. The movie also has some moments of levity and humour that don't take away from the grittiness of the setting and the plot. A very good watch.<p>
