    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>I'm just as surprised as you, I did not know that Sinatra acted. This movie is exciting and full of suspense. It also has many hidden touches and subtle hints. It is one of those films where you will debate with your friends about a certain character's actions and intentions. A compelling ambiguity, combined with the twists and turns of the plot, and the historical context surrounding it makes this movie a must-watch.<p>
