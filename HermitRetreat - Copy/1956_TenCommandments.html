    <p>This film is not a light watch, clocking in at a little over 3 hours. The amount of money they dumped into this thing is insane. Just looking at the sets, the effects, the sheer volume of people on screen. Along with the subject matter, this movie will loom over and you will be consumed by it like a fish being caught in the maw of a whale. If any movie can be called an "epic", this is it.<p>
