    <p>In Battle Royale, you get to fulfill your fantasy of watching ninth graders getting killed in violent and horrible ways. This film falls on the more pulpy, exploitation side of the spectrum, but it's alright. Most of the characters simply exist for poorly-developed romance subplots with violent conclusions. The real heart of the movie is Takeshi Kitano's character who takes on the more emotionally-touching moments of the movie. I can recommend this movie alongside the ranks of slasher flicks and mindless action movies. I would also recommend that you get the "Special Edition" as it has some extra scenes that add a lot to the movie and strengthen the narrative.<p>
