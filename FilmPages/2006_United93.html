    <p>I love movies that examine the early 2000's and make use of its aesthetics. This movie certainly covers events that are instrumental in forming our modern day existence. The first portion of this film is a masterclass in creating suspense and putting you on edge, all with simple scenes of people doing basic stuff on a plane. I wasn't around when the 9/11 attacks happened, but I have a feeling that the characters' reactions to the dark realization of what's happening around them is close to the truth. Probably the closest any of us are ever gonna get to the feeling of what it was like on that day short of watching actual footage of the events.<p>
