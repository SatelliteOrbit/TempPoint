    <p>A silent classic from the age where film was a novelty. This movie has so much heart poured into it and it's amazing to see these pioneering actors and filmmakers see how much they can do with this medium. From what I hear there's a colourized version of this out there made by Star Film. Not colourized as in shot on colour film, colourized as in a bunch of technicians painted the frames by hand. Amazing.<p>
