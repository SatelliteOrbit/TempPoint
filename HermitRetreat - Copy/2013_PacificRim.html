    <p>The most action-packed allegory for climate change you'll watch (I'm serious, look it up). The action is great, the characters are interesting, and the score keeps up every step of the way. If you think the main theme is the greatest thing ever, that's because Tom Morello worked on it. The only serious critique I have is that some of the acting from the main characters is stilted. Despite that, the side characters are really great to watch. It's not just mindless action either, the world and the way it's presented is legitimately compelling.  Highly recommend.<p>
