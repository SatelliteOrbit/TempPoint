    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>I've only watched a few of the shorts. They are very well-animated and each one is visually-distinct. The stories are usually mediocre, the plots only serve the function of showing some really good animation. Despite that there are some interesting concepts and ideas being presented.<p>
