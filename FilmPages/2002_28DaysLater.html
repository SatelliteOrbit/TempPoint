    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>Zombies may have been formulated by Romero, but this movie brought them to the modern day. Pretty much any piece of zombie media today has taken influence from this film. The zombies are frightening and the plot is gripping. The movie is dark one, but it also has moments of levity and fun. Highly recommend.<p>
