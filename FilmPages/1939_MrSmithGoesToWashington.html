    <p>Another Hollywood classic starring James Stewart. The man certainly knew how to pick his movies. Despite its age, this film still manages to make political observations applicable to the challenges democracies face in the modern day as well as being educational. We all wonder what we would do if we were given political power. In this movie that scenario is put to the test, what happens when an ordinary person like you or me is admitted into the halls of power? Sad, funny, and full of suspense. Highly recommend.<p>
