    <p>One of my personal favourites, I've lost count of how many times I've rewatched it. Anderson's cinematography, use of colour, and editing make this one of the most visually distinct movies in the collection. A very nice touch is how the aspect ratio changes depending on what decade is being retold by the characters (the plot is mainly told as a narration by different characters). The choice of aspect ratio isn't arbitrary, it corresponds to the standard aspect ratios used to shoot and screen movies in the relevant decade. The story is exciting and will keep you attached to the screen. It is part murder mystery and part buddy-cop roadtrip. The strong characters are played by a cast carrying some impressive names, including cameos of Bill Murray and LÃ©a Seydoux. Although there are humorous moments, this one will leave an afterglow of melancholy.</p>
    <p>This movie is inspired by the novels of Stefan Zweig, an early 20th Century Austrian writer who lived through both World Wars. After reading a couple chapters of "Beware of Pity" I noticed some callbacks and refrences in the movie. Zweig was an interesting and tragic figure you should look into.<p>
