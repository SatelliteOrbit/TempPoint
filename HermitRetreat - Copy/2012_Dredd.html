    <h3 class="subhead">Personal Comments:</h3>
    <p>An incredibely violent and fun action movie that is the best cinematic adaptation of the Judge Dredd comic book series to the silver screen. The effects and look of this movie are simply amazing. It takes some serious balls to hire a big actor and obsucre his face behind a helmet for the entirety of the film. Too bad it didn't pay off.</p>
    <p>Despite its high quality, this movie was a commercial failure. Unfortunately, an R-rated film based on an obsucre comic book series could not compete with films coming out in the same season like Django, Looper, Prometheus, Killing Them Softly, and The Avengers. As much as I love Dredd, it didn't stand a chance. I would have loved to see this in 3D. Fortunately, audiences have appreciated this film in retrospect and it has developed a cult-following. Too bad that its poor performance means that we won't see a worthwhile sequel.</p>
